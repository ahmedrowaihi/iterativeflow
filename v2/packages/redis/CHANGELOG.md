### Minor Changes

- eab5c26: New backend: **`@iterativeflow/redis`** — the four ports over one ioredis connection, for Redis /
  Valkey / Dragonfly (single node). State and dispatch share the keyspace, so the transactional outbox
  commits as one Lua script; the Queue is sorted-set lease-CAS (crash recovery via lease expiry), the
  Timer a `fireAt` sorted set, and Wakeup is in-process. Durability is the server's AOF config — the
  fast, loss-tolerant tier. Passes the same store/queue/timer/wakeup/outbox/signal/reconcile/cron/engine
  conformance suites as the Postgres and DynamoDB backends. `ioredis` is a peer dependency.

### Patch Changes

- e1ef077: Pre-release audit pass — correctness, consistency, and hardening fixes:

  - **core (cron at-most-once bug):** `runDueCrons` now starts the occurrence's idempotent run BEFORE
    advancing the schedule CAS. Previously a crash between `advanceCron` and `startRun` dropped the
    occurrence silently — at-most-once delivery inside an otherwise at-least-once engine. Also adds the
    `orphanedRunsSql` and `assertSqlIdentifier` backend-SPI helpers.
  - **mysql (atomicity bug):** transactions now run at READ COMMITTED, not MySQL's REPEATABLE READ
    default, so a concurrent first-writer-wins checkpoint's re-read sees the winner's just-committed
    row — matching Postgres, the model the store targets. Surfaced by a new concurrency conformance
    test.
  - **dynamodb / mongodb (lease version):** `claim` captures the job `version` from the atomic lease
    write (`ReturnValues: ALL_NEW` / the `findOneAndUpdate` result) rather than a stale pre-lease read,
    matching the other six backends.
  - **redis (performance):** `listRuns` scans the run index in bounded windows instead of loading every
    run on an interactive page.
  - **postgres:** the job `version` seeds at 1 like every other backend; the orphan query uses the
    shared `orphanedRunsSql`. **sqlite / mysql** share the same builder (one predicate, one home).
  - **hardening:** the webhook `hmacVerifier` refuses an empty secret at construction (fail closed);
    the SQL backends validate the schema/table-prefix identifier at construction.
