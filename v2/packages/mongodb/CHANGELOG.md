### Minor Changes

- b1c88d8: New backend: **`@iterativeflow/mongodb`** — the four ports over one MongoClient, runs as documents
  (one collection per concern, `_id = runId`). The transactional outbox commits across collections in a
  multi-document transaction, so a replica set is required (as MongoDB mandates for transactions);
  single-document ops like `claim` and `arriveAtJoin` use per-document atomicity. Timestamps are epoch
  ms, insertion order is a per-doc ObjectId, and the idempotency/signal-dedup indexes are partial
  (`$exists`) so unkeyed docs never collide. Wakeup is in-process. Passes all nine conformance suites.
  `mongodb` is a peer dependency.

### Patch Changes

- e1ef077: Pre-release audit pass — correctness, consistency, and hardening fixes:

  - **core (cron at-most-once bug):** `runDueCrons` now starts the occurrence's idempotent run BEFORE
    advancing the schedule CAS. Previously a crash between `advanceCron` and `startRun` dropped the
    occurrence silently — at-most-once delivery inside an otherwise at-least-once engine. Also adds the
    `orphanedRunsSql` and `assertSqlIdentifier` backend-SPI helpers.
  - **mysql (atomicity bug):** transactions now run at READ COMMITTED, not MySQL's REPEATABLE READ
    default, so a concurrent first-writer-wins checkpoint's re-read sees the winner's just-committed
    row — matching Postgres, the model the store targets. Surfaced by a new concurrency conformance
    test.
  - **dynamodb / mongodb (lease version):** `claim` captures the job `version` from the atomic lease
    write (`ReturnValues: ALL_NEW` / the `findOneAndUpdate` result) rather than a stale pre-lease read,
    matching the other six backends.
  - **redis (performance):** `listRuns` scans the run index in bounded windows instead of loading every
    run on an interactive page.
  - **postgres:** the job `version` seeds at 1 like every other backend; the orphan query uses the
    shared `orphanedRunsSql`. **sqlite / mysql** share the same builder (one predicate, one home).
  - **hardening:** the webhook `hmacVerifier` refuses an empty secret at construction (fail closed);
    the SQL backends validate the schema/table-prefix identifier at construction.
